                        Debate, or forensics, is a highly sophisticated communicative skill, especially useful to students planning to enter professions such as law, teaching, broadcasting, the ministry, theater, etc. where public speaking is required. Membership is open to all students in grades 9–12. New members are always welcome; no experience is necessary.
                    CR North’s Debate team competes in the Southeastern PA Debate League, which is comprised of both Bucks and Montgomery county schools. We also compete in various National and Catholic League Tournaments. Members of the team may choose between debate and speech events.
                    There are four forms of debate to choose from: Policy, Public Forum, Lincoln Douglas, and Speech – with Speech having three separate sub-categories. Tournaments are held mostly on Wednesdays and on various weekends, which is dependent upon NFL or NCFL dates. Tournaments are currently being held virtually for the safety of all participants.   Practices are regularly scheduled for Tuesdays evenings and are currently being held virtually.  The season runs September - June.
